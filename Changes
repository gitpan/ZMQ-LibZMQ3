Changes
=======

1.19 Oct 28 2014
    - Fix return value of recvmsg() to actually return an undef value
      when the underlying call to the raw recvmsg() fails (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/issues/28)

1.18 Jul 08 2014
    - Fix broken zmq_disconnect/zmq_unbind/zmq_socket_monitor (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/issues/59)

1.17 Jun 18 2014
    - Fix docs on zmq_msg_recv() (Giacomo Montagner)
    - Do away with tools/zmqcheck, and use Devel::CheckLib (nponeccop)
    - Fix breakage on windows for t/100_basic.t (nponeccop)
    - Fix breakage on windows for t/104_ipc.t and t/106_last_endpoint.t (noponeccop)
    - Skip t/200_fork.t on windows (noponeccop)

1.16 May 03 2014
    - Fix locale dependent tests (J. Gomez)
    - Fix ZMQ_LAST_ENDPOINT (Michael Gray)

1.15 Nov 26 2013
    - Skip tests when linking against libzmq4 (cdybedahl pr #45)
      (Note: if/when libzmq4 API diverges from libzmq3, you should be
       using ZMQ::LibZMQ4 -- which hasn't been written yet -- instead of
       ZMQ::LibZMQ4)

1.14 Nov 26 2013
    - Fix Makefile.PL for OS X (reported by cdybedahl, #43)

1.13 Jun 10 2013
    - Add zmq_disconnect (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/pull/40)
    - Merge change to work with Alien::ZMQ (Robin Lee)
    - Remove Module::Install::Repository from check_mi_mods.pl (only affects people working from git repo)

1.12 May 30 2013
    - Fix memory leak from getsockopt reported by og01
    - Fix Makefile.PL clean_files specification (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/issues/32)
    - Fix where we declare PERL_GCC_PEDANTIC

1.11 May 09 2013
    - Add a define for PERL_GCC_PEDANTIC in zmqcheck
    - Fix memory leak in zmq_recv(), reported by Ton Nijkes (rt #85153)
    - Fix silly warning on test

1.10 Mar 01 2013
    - No code change
    - Remove MYMETA.* from distro (http://weblog.bulknews.net/post/44251476706/stop-shipping-mymeta-to-cpan)

1.09 Jan 24 2013
    - Add zmq_errno() and zmq_strerror() to @EXPORT, so the following works
          use ZMQ::LibZMQ qw(zmq_errno);
      Previously zmq_errno() and zmq_strerror() existed, but could not be
      imported (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/issues/26, @emceelam).

1.08 Jan 19 2013
    - Only overwrite zmq_init/zmq_term if zmq_ctx_new/zmq_ctx_destroy are
      available AND zmq_init/zmq_term are not.
    - Take caution not to cause warnings while doing so.

1.07 Jan 16 2013
    - Remove some Module::Install plugins.
    - Add tests for zmq_msg_send() (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/pull/24,  @domm)

1.06 Jan 12 2013
    - t/100_basic.t uses POSIX::setlocale() to force $! stringification
      (rt #82613, reported by Konstantin A. Pustovalov)
    - struct -> object, object -> struct conversion has now been
      converted to a generic macro.
    - Doc updates
    - House cleaning (shouldn't be visible to users)

1.05 Jan 09 2013
    - Make sure to specify c99 in zmqcheck.
    - Make sure to specify -pedantic-errors in zmqcheck.
    - Makefile.PL now warns if zmqcheck fails to compile everything,
      which is most certainly wrong.
    - Minor test cleanup.

1.04 Jan 09 2013
    - zmq_proxy(), zmq_device() should now be usable (if your underlying
      libzmq has them). Thanks for @melo and @domm for testing.
    - Added mechanism to check if deprecated/new functions are available.
      Currently these functions are checked:
        zmq_init
        zmq_ctx_destroy
        zmq_ctx_get
        zmq_ctx_new
        zmq_ctx_set
        zmq_device
        zmq_msg_recv
        zmq_msg_send
        zmq_proxy
        zmq_recvmsg
        zmq_socket_monitor
        zmq_sendmsg
        zmq_term
        zmq_unbind
    - Of the above functions, zmq_init, zmq_term, zmq_sendmsg, zmq_recmsg
      are marked as deprecated by recent libzmq3.
      ZMQ::LibZMQ3 being a Perl module, we'll try to be backwards compatible
      as much as possible, so it will silently fallback to using the
      right replacement, i.e.:
        zmq_init    -> zmq_ctx_new
        zmq_term    -> zmq_ctx_destroy
        zmq_sendmsg -> zmq_msg_send
        zmq_recvmsg -> zmq_msg_recv
      However, we may decide to start complaining in the future versions.
      You have been warned.
    - Of the above functions, the following functions are newly added,
      AS LONG AS THE UNDERLYING libzmq SUPPORTS IT:
        zmq_ctx_new
        zmq_ctx_destroy
        zmq_ctx_get
        zmq_ctx_set
        zmq_msg_recv
        zmq_msg_send
        zmq_socket_monitor
        zmq_unbind
      If the underlying libzmq does not support any of these functions,
      it will croak.

1.03 - Jan 05 2013
    - Update docs

1.02 - Dec 26 2012
    - Fix tools/detect_zmq.pl as it was checking for old libzmq2 version
      (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/pull/17), pr by @andyjones
    - EXPERIMENTAL: Add zmq_proxy(). Test cases are most welcome.
      (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/issues/16)
    - Fix SYNOPSIS for zmq_send(msg)?, zmq_recv(msg)?

1.01 - Oct 09 2012
    - Fix memory leak in zmq_recvmsg(), retported by trinitum
      (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/issues/15)

1.00 - Aug 22 2012
    - Fix implicit and explicit destructors for context and sockets.
      (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/issues/11), spotted by @melo

      Previously this threw an assertion:

        my $ctxt = zmq_init();
        my $pid = fork();
        exit(0) unless $pid;
        waitpid($pid, 0);

     This is because $ctxt was being freed on both the child and the parent.

     As of this version, we make sure that behind the scenes the context 
     can only be freed in the process and thread that it was created in.
     Likewise sockets can only be freed within the same process.

1.00_03 - Apr 23 2012
    - Changed zmq_poll()'s return value. In list context, you can get the
      array of boolean values indicating if the particular socket got fired

        my @fired = zmq_poll(...);

      In scalar context, you get the return value of zmq_poll() from the C
      layer

        my $rv = zmq_poll(...)

      See https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/pull/1 (Steffen Mueller, Nick Peres)

    - Fix getsockopt_string() 
      https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/pull/2 (Sergey KHripchenko)

1.00_02 - Mar 26 2012
    - Beef up the docs extensively.
    - Make sure to set $! upo failure
    - Add author tests
    - Change zmq_sendmsg to a pure perl method.
    - Make sure to emulate libzmq2 errors for stuff like trying to act upon
      closed cxt, sockets, and messages, since we don't call the C level
      functions when we detect that they have been closed from the Perl level.


1.00_01 - Mar 24 2012
    - Initial release.
